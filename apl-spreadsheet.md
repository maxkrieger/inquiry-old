# Linear Algebra as Spreadsheet

_Thanks to Garth Goldwater for a lot of the ideas here_

[The metaphor isn't mine](https://betterexplained.com/articles/linear-algebra-guide/). But it's a good one!

So I was wondering why nobody took it literally.

I can't find any existing _direct manipulation_ interfaces to perform linear algebra on raw data. Stuff like eigendecomposition or factorization. Or [constructing proofs of SVD](http://cognitivemedium.com/emm/emm.html).

The key, I think, is to map the _language_ of linear algebra to an _interaction semantics_ for linear algebra ([[interaction-semantics]]).

Here's what I _have_ found:

## Excel!?

Sure I guess?

- [Performing Operations with Matrices on Spreadsheets](https://www.jstor.org/stable/27970545?seq=1)

## APL is really cool

It's a REPL interface, and a really old one. But it's all about performing abstract operations on concrete data. Reminds me of [PANE](http://joshuahhh.com/projects/pane/)'s philosophy: "programming with visible data".

The weird runic incantations like [`r←,⍳⊢ ⋄ (r G) ≡ r ∘.{⍺[⍵]}⍨ ↓r G`](https://www.jsoftware.com/papers/50/50_12.htm) are super charming as well. Sure it's intimidating to look at, but the semantics could perhaps be turned into direct manipulation semantics ([[interaction-semantics]])?

[Here's a bunch of college-level math textbooks where the examples are in APL](https://www.jsoftware.com/books/pdf/). All by Iverson(?).

### other

- What if there was a set of flashcards to learn all the APL symbols? Like [Elixir Cards](https://elixircards.co.uk/)/[PixelSpirit](https://patriciogonzalezvivo.github.io/PixelSpiritDeck/).

One subproject ([[subprojecting]]) is not APL, but some CAS matrix toy.

## Why?

- Not sure.
  - Might be internalized trauma taking linear algebra without something that feels nice to use ([[microworld-languages]]).
  - Practitioners make numpy mistakes a lot I bet
  - How do you communicate intuition about [powerful ideas](https://llk.media.mit.edu/courses/readings/Papert-Big-Idea.pdf) in linalg? Are pictures the best we have? What about the _algebra_, and the _data_ embedded in every matrix?
- The semantics of Linear Algebra are pretty well-defined I think? That's why it's an algebra, right?
- I want to do casual mathematics
- Linear Algebra can model a lot of other domains of math. Not to mention it's pretty useful for physics. So maybe the interface paradigm can be juiced into domain-specific applications ([[juicing]], [[bottom-up]]).
