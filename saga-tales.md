# Chat Documents

For nearly a year I've been struggling to build a prototype, solo, what I outlined in [Chatting with Glue](https://a9.io/glue-comic).

So I'm making an intermediate prototype without the hard parts (privacy, authentication, notifications), using Firebase. It'll resemble a chat app but will nominally be a collaborative outliner tool. For meeting notes and such.
